# Lightbox #
A game engine built with OpenGL and Rust.

Lightbox aims to provide a set of helper modules and methods to build games and other game-related tools like level editors. It primarily aims to provide window abstractions, rendering simplifications, input management, and asset management systems.
The playground project contains an example of how to setup a game with Lightbox.

### Building ###
1. Install [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick_guide.html)
2. `cargo run` to run the playground
